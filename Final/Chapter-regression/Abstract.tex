We propose a new class of nonconvex penalty functions in the paradigm of multitask sparse penalized regression that are based on data depth-based inverse ranking. Focusing on a one-step sparse estimator of the coefficient matrix using local linear approximation of the penalty function, we derive its theoretical properties and provide the algorithm for its computation. For orthogonal design and independent responses, the resulting thresholding rule enjoys near-minimax optimal risk performance, similar to the adaptive lasso \citep{Zou06}. A simulation study as well as real data analysis demonstrate its effectiveness compared to present methods that provide sparse solutions in multivariate regression.
